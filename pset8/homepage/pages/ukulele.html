        <h1>The love for music</h1>
        <em>A sound, a love, just feel.</em>

        <p>
            Music came into my life as a teenager. I always wanted to learn an instrument, but we had other priorities in the family. At the age of 14, when I started working, I decided to buy my first instrument, a simple electric keyboard.

            Working and studying, I didn't have enough time to train, but I applied myself to music schools for a period. The responsibilities have grown. Soon, I had to leave music studies.
        </p>
        <p>
            After a decade, I decided to buy a real piano. But, other priorities came up and I had to leave music studies again. So, I got married, rented an apartment and in 2020, with the proposal to make life lighter, I decided to buy a Ukulele. Moving from the keys to the strings.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm still at the beginning of this learning with the strings, but my "Uke" has a full-bodied sound, perfect for quiet music, the style I like. Learning? I don't know, just that I never stop learning.
