        <h1>My trip to Tibet</h1>
        <em>We are a cluster of yesterdays, choose the happy ones to remember.</em>
        <br><br>
        <p>
            In the photo above I was 4500 meters above sea level somewhere in Tibet. To give you an idea of ​​how high it can be, the peak of Jaraguá in São Paulo is 1,135 meters.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was happy, but very afraid, because the little oxygen and the cold helped me not to think clearly. Clarity, without a doubt, a difficult thing to have when we are afraid or in pain (in my case, pain from being so cold).
        </p>
        <p>
            Tibet is considered the highest region in the world, also known as "the roof of the world", as its average altitude is 4900 meters. Since 1950, when it was occupied by the Chinese, Tibet is no longer considered an independent country. This requires authorization from the Chinese government to enter its territory.
        </p>
        <p>
            On this day, the Buddhist group I traveled with, had the day scheduled to visit a monastery that is isolated on a very high mountain, above 5000 meters in altitude. Monastery is a kind of residence of Buddhist monks. As I had to choose between talking or walking, and the hikes were many, I had time to observe everything around.
        </p>
        <p>
            After almost an hour by bus, always going up, on a road of a breathtaking landscape, both for the beauty and the number of curves, we arrived at the entrance to the park. There, getting off the bus, we walked for another thirty minutes until we saw the monastery.
        </p>
        <p>
            There was a small door. We had to take off our shoes before entering, but don't worry, no matter how many shoes were left there, always when we came back, they were still there, maybe a little more to the side or under some other shoe, but they were always there.
        </p>
        <p>    
            Upon entering the small door, a large room with several supporting columns, a huge altar and three thrones, one larger in the center and the other two, one on the left and the other on the right of the central throne. The thrones are the places where the teachers sit to teach. They explained to us that thrones are used to teach, because what is taught is considered sacred. Masters are respected for their knowledge, but the greatest importance is given to the content taught.
        </p>
        <p>
            All the walls of the room, including the ceiling and the supporting columns, were covered with sacred paintings, consisting of symbols of Tibetan Buddhism, there was not a single place without these paintings. According to the masters, our mind is influenced by all our senses, be it sight, hearing, touch, smell, etc. So, the paintings serve to direct the mind towards something positive.

        </p>
        <p>
            The monks were lined up, side by side, sitting on a kind of mat with a thick rug on top. There were about ten rows of monks in front of the thrones, each with about twenty monks. A small table was in front of each one, forming corridors.
        </p>
        <p>
            They recited mantras with a calm melody, but inside the room the sound echoed resoundingly, creating a subtle vibration that made it possible to feel the melody through the body as well. I will never forget that moment. We sat on the floor in front of the monks' small tables. Without stopping to recite the mantras, they looked at us and smiled, offering the fruits and other foods that were on their tables. I was moved. There was something in that place and you couldn't explain it in words, just feel it.
        </p>
        <p>
            We spent the day in the park. In front of the main building was an open courtyard and another building with three or four establishments that sold small souvenirs. Most of the items for sale were handcrafted, made by the monks of the monastery, the sale of which was invested in financial resources to maintain the place. Some people were offered a free outdoor lunch. We returned at the end of the afternoon to where we got off the bus. About two hours later we were already at our hotel.
        </p>

            I believe that in a broader perspective, we can make two types of travel: external and internal. This is the external trip we make visiting places, whether near or far from where we live. But there is also the type of internal travel. The one we do when reading a book, when we listen to a song, watch something on TV or even when we sit in silence and start to imagine or remember places and situations we experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            The trip to Tibet, in particular, allowed me to do both the external and the internal travel. I watched inside and outside myself. I realized that our way of looking at things is always loaded with emotions and feelings. Each thing lived, brings with it a sensation. This sensation is rarely neutral. It can be both positive and negative. Sometimes, in addition to physical sensations, such as small pains in the body or not being able to eat at the time we were used to, caused negative emotions to increase, but they didn't take long to pass, just looking at a landscape or remembering something or someone special, that positive emotions appeared.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, it became clear to me that we are a cluster of experiences that we have lived. That these experiences carry emotions and that remembering them, whether silently or sharing with other people, gives a greater sense to what was lived, making each time we tell, we relive what happened. So, I thank you for the opportunity to share this memory and, with that, relive a positive and precious experience.
