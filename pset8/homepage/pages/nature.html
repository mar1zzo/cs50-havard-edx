        <h1>A place to reconnect with nature</h1>
        <em>What has to be, is.</em>

        <p>
            Pauba, is a beach on the north coast of Sao Paulo. Located in the municipality of Sao Sebastiao, as it is far from the highway and surrounded by green mountains, it maintains its preserved nature.

            It was on this beach that I found myself again with nature. After long quarantine months due to the pandemic, two large losses in the family and internally worn out by the stress of the situation.

            Pauba brought beauty back to my life, but above all, it brought hope and faith. Certain things, only nature can show us. I returned to hope and redid the plans after the pandemic. Learn to swim and start a sport in the sea, perhaps the Stand up paddle. I realized that nature heals many things, from the inside out and from the outside in. Maybe in a few months I will update these pages with more photos of these new life projects. Aloha!
